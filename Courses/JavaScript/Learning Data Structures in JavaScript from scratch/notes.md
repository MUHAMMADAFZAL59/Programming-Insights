# Learning Data Structures in JavaScript from scratch

## What are data structures

- A way of organizing data that is stored in a computer or database

- Many different types of data structures

- Each type of data structure represents a different way or organizing the data.

## Why are there different types of data structures?

- They all have different strengths and weaknesses
- Some are fast at *storing* and *recording* data, while others are not
- Some are fast at *searching* and *retrieving* data, while others are not

Why are data structures important to know?

- Can have big impact on how *perfomant*, *quick*, and *efficiently* a program runs
- Reinfore knowledge of JavaScript algorithms and other important concepts
- Be very well prepared for technical interview questions

## Big O Notation

- Constant time - Big O Notation: "0 (1)"
- Linear time - Big O Notation: "0 (n)"
- Exponential runtime - Big O Notation: "0 (n^2)"
- Logarithmic runtime - Big O Notation: 0 (log n)

## Linked List

Good for examples app for: 'poker'

Memory Management Benefits:

  - Data doesn't to be stored together

## The binary search tree

Very fast for search a node.

Good:

  - Dictionary
  - Phone book
  - Users

## Hash table

Runtime:

  - Lookup: 0 (1)
  - Insertion: 0 (1)

Very fast runtime

{
  key: "Pizza",
  value: "$2.25"
}

Don't store references to other pieces of data in the data structure
