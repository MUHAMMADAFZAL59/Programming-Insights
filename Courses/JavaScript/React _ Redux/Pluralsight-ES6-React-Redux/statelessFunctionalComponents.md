 1. No class needed
 2. Avoid `this` keyword
    > No need to do `bind(this)` etc. Make a component easier to reed.
 3. Enforced best practices
 4. High signal-to-noise-ratio
 5. Enhanced code completion / intellisense
 6. Bloated components are obvious
 7. Easy to understand
 8. Easy to test
 9. Performance

Use functional component whenever its possible
