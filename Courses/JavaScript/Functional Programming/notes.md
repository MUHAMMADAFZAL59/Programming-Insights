# Higher-order function

Functions are values so we can use this for separated our code into small and simple function

This is good for composition

So we can have small function into bigger one

- Filter

    > Go through a array, throw object away. Transform an array into a smaller one.
- Reject

    > Go through a array. Reverse of filter.
- Find

    > Like filter but return the first item.
- Map

    > Go through a array. Transform a aray with the same length but with each individual item transform.
- Reduce

    > Go through a array. Super transformation.
