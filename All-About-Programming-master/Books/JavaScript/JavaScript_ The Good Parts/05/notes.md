# Inheritance

JavaScript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects.

---

# Pseudoclassical

Instead of having objects inherit directly from other objects, an unnecessary level of indirection is inserted such that objects are produced by constructor functions.

There is a convention that all constructor functions are named with an initial capital.

---

# Object Specifiers

It sometimes happens that a constructor is given a very large number of parameters.

This can be troublesome because it can be very difficult to remember the order of the arguments.

In such cases, it can be much friendlier if we write the constructor to accept a single object specifier instead.
