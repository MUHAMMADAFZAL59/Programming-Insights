Like rails with use inside the controller rest convention like `index, show, create, edit, update, new, delete`


`{1, 2, 3}` this is an tuple

`:hello` this is an atom

`[1, 2, 3]` this is an list

We can use `{:ok, status}` and do what we want at this point and same with error.

We have if else statement
