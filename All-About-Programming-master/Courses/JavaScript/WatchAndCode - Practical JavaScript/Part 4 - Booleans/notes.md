We want to add a completed property for the todo.
Ex:
``` javascript
todos: {
    todoText: 'hello',
    completed: false
}
```

### What we want to do in this part: 
- todoList.addTodo should add objects
- todoList.changeTodo should change the todoText property
- todoList.toggleCompleted should change the completed property

> toggleCompleted is like a light switch

    ! mean opposite
    
    !false = true
    
    !true = false
