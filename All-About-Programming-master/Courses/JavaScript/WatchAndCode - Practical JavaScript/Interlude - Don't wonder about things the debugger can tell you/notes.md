## Debug

For stop the program you can add the word

    debugger;

where you want to stop the program. So with that you can debug your code and see what happen ex: before a error etc.

In the debugger window ( when the gray screen appear in chrome ) you can see at the right a set of tool for help the programmer.

In { this } you can see all the method who go with the object.

You have a button call { step over next function call }. His super useful!!!!!

# USE THE DEBUGGER

Check inside the debugger if you code work well for be sure this is right.
