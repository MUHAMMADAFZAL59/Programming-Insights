# Motion Design Theory: Dynamic Compositions

## Tips

1. Start Extreme, then pull it back
2. Larger/contrast = More Important
3. Treat type as another shape

First off, when I refer to “contrast,” what I mean is: giving contrast to every visual component that makes up a single frame– value, weight, size, and color. By utilizing contrast, you’re able to control and define hierarchy, movement, and meaning.

- 1 really BIG object — usually the subject, and most important element in the frame.
- 1–2 medium sized objects — secondary elements to give meaning to the main object.
- Tons of very tiny objects — tertiary elements to give movement and additional context for the frame.
