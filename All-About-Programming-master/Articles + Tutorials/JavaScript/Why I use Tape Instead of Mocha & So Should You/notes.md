# Why I use Tape Instead of Mocha & So Should You

When you write a bug report, you should always provide a description, explain what you expected to see, and explain what you actually saw.

Test cases should be written in much the same way:

1. Describe the feature that youâ€™re testing in plain English.
2. Provide the expected outcome of the test. This part is why many unit tests are called expectations.
3. Compare that to the actual value.

```js
import test from 'tape';

test('A passing test', (assert) => {

  assert.pass('This test will pass.');

  assert.end();
});

test('Assertions with tape.', (assert) => {
  const expected = 'something to test';
  const actual = 'sonething to test';

  assert.equal(actual, expected,
    'Given two mismatched values, .equal() should produce a nice bug report');

  assert.end();
});
```
