## PWA

1. Long-term caching - Webpack gives us long-term caching for free
2. Lazy-loading and code splitting - progressive web apps are not only about offline but also reducing data usage
3. Talk to the API and cache only the most relevant part of this communication
4. Multiple caching strategies - depend on the request properties or user actions
5. Possibility to clear the userâ€™s browser cache
6. Service Worker as an enhancement not as a requirement (shame on you IE and Safari)
