Not all components are available on all platform.

We can make the ios and android component in their own file and import it. Or we can use the `{ Platform }` and toggle
the good one right in the file.

For the style his better with `Stylesheet.create` cause he render one time if put at the end of the file.

The book show a way for building style with folder for each component
